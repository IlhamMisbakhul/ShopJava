# This is Java basic Project

## Java Simpe Cashier App
This is a simple cashier project using Java language. This project is really good if you wanted to use it for a college project, if yout university was using Java to teach you. You can clone this project if you are interested. FYI, this project was not using any databases and every text that are displayed was using Indonesian, so you have to translate that to English if you're not from Indonesia, but it's a good strt for your project.

## Tutorial
For the tutorial, you can open the Microsoft Word file, but you need to translate text on that file from Indonesian to english. But, if you're from Indonesia, you are so lucky then lol.
